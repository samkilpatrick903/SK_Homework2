Homework 2 - Portfolio

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to create a portfolio webpage.

The webpage is fully responsive and and includes hover effects.

The body of the webpage contains 3 sections that are accessible from the nav bar links.

I collaborated with students, AskBCS, and my tutor to help form and tweak the html and CSS.
